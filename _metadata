  "description" : "[h1]ANNOUNCEMENT[/h1]\n[h2]Mod partially on Hiatus for Armor Adapt and RenTek: Project Awaken[/h2]\nThe lucario mod is in a partial hiatus while I train under the crew of RenTek to become an even better mod developer. RenTek so far has gotten my skills up to another level, but it is far from being public ready. RenTek is mostly a weapon based mod so I am learning how to make more advanced modded weapons from my time there. When I come back full swing here, you can expect the weapons of the Lucario Race to get an overhaul and possibly a selection of new weaponry.\n\nGranted my training at RenTek is not going to waste. I have been developing a mod called \"Armor Adapt\", not just for the lucario to use, but the entire modding scene as a whole. Armor Adapt is a mod that can swap the images of clothing/armor to something that actually fits the species you are playing as if the supported alternate images for the item are made. As of such, the lucario will be one of the first race mods to take advantage of the Armor Adapt system and you will no longer have to worry about some clothing not fitting you. All of the lucario clothing/armors will be reworked to use this system (only if installed) thus making it so you do not have to craft a different item for every different body type lucario. One item with armor adapt support will work for any lucario appearance you choose. As a bonus, the more mods that make compatibility with Armor Adapt and the more artwork made for alternate looks, the easier it will become to share outfits with players who are not the same race.\n\nArmor Adapt is in development and hopefully will promote a new era of sharing outfits between different mods.\n\n[h2]A Big Update is out for the Lucario Race, see the changes I made here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/2791621875940465124/[/h2]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/nRwmbpG.png[/img]\n\n[url=http://community.playstarbound.com/members/ochiru-yuki.257329/][img]https://i.imgur.com/DtjlSVx.png[/img][/url]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/O1B2GZA.png[/img]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734855062][img]https://i.imgur.com/TUm90NN.png[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729480149][img]https://i.imgur.com/bY8J9PV.png[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=763259329][img]https://i.imgur.com/CCIqWUi.png[/img][/url]\n[quote][h1]For Information on Frackin Universe/Races Compatibility and to report bugs of issues with the Lucario and Frackin Universe/Races, Visit here:[/h1]\n[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/3288067088095861985/]Lucario FrackinRaces Mod Compatibility[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2232652761][img]https://i.imgur.com/jQcWuXu.png[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2232650711][img]https://i.imgur.com/IEcEOsM.png[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2232652058][img]https://i.imgur.com/YfI2zPO.png[/img][/url]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/h9hTNsQ.png[/img]\nThis mod adds the lucario species to your game with over 4,000,000 different possible outcomes in character creation. By changing colors you can access tons of possibilities for your unique lucario. The options you have now are insane, and can be increased further by installing the other mods in this series.\n[quote][h1]For information on character creation, body types, or how this has so many possibilities, go here:[/h1]\n[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/1743352529775560699/]Character Creation[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/Bfuydy5.png[/img]\nThe Lucario Race adds in new items. These range from new swords to crafting materials. More items will come with updates. Most of these items will be avaliable to the lucario solely, although some are for every race to be able to spawn lucario NPCs.\n[quote][h1]For information on items and objects, check here:[/h1]\n[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/1743352529775729738/]Item List[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/RfVboA1.png[/img]\n[quote][list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/1743352529775804767/]NPC Tenants, guards, etc Information[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/fIZES5o.png[/img]\nThis is a mod after all and ChuckleFish updates Starbound every once in a while.
