Make a small home with a door and a light source. Go to the inventor's table and craft the Auracite Crystallizer. Place the Auracite Crystallizer in the home and place a colony deed. A special NPC should spawn in with a quest already ready. Completing the quest should give you 2,000 Essence of Aura.[/b][/quote]\n[h1]Now you can be a Fluzzy Lucario. Take control of the famous Aura Jackal as a Playable Race.[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\n\nThe lucario race is a mod inspired by a fictional species, Lucario, belonging to Game Freak, Pokemon, and the concept creator Ken Sugimori. This is a fan mod, attempting to add the race to Starbound. All artwork in this mod was crafted by dedicated fans and developers. It has been re-created without the use of original material, visually. The mod tries to make the lucario mesh into the Starbound universe and is constantly building to try to integrate into the lore.\n\nIn no way does this mod incorporate features of the Pokemon games, but instead tries to make the lucario in a way that fits Starbound.\n[quote][h1]This mod was originally created by Ochiru Yuki:[/h1]\n[url=http://community.playstarbound.com/members/ochiru-yuki.257329/]Ochiru Yuki on the Official Starbound Forums[/url]\nI have the grace and green light of the Original Author to bring this mod to you.\n[/quote]\n[quote][h1]For Information on Frackin' Races Compatibility and to report bugs of issues with the Lucario and Frackin' Races, Visit here:[/h1]\n[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/3288067088095861985/]Lucario FrackinRaces Mod Compatibility[/url][/list][/quote]\n[h1]Wardrobe Interface Compatibility[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\nThanks to\n[quote][h1]Silverfeelin[/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Silverfeelin[/quote]\nThe Lucario race has been given a significant upgrade, which only gives you the correct armor recipes for your body type at start. This means that in return, the Lucario Race is FULLY compatible with the Wardrobe mod series. You do not require a third mod to make this species compatible. Although if you don't want the Wardrobe Interface mod series, you don't have to. The lucario race runs fine without it.\n[quote][h1]If you don't have Wardrobe Interface and want to try it out, check it out HERE!![/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734855062[/quote]\n\n[h1]Species[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\nThis mod adds the lucario species to your game with over 60,000,000 different possible outcomes in character creation. This mod is the first to incorporate multiple body types and a neutral option without the use of separate mods. By changing colors you can access tons of possibilities for your unique lucario. The options you have now are insane, it is questionable if more choices will be added in the future or not.\n[quote][h1]For information on character creation, body types, or how this has so many possibilities, go here:[/h1]\n[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/1743352529775560699/]Character Creation[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[h1]Items and Objects[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\nThe Lucario Race adds in new items. These range from new swords to crafting materials. More items will come with updates. Most of these items will be avaliable to the lucario solely, although some are for every race to be able to spawn lucario NPCs.\n[quote][h1]For information on items and objects, check here:[/h1]\n[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/1743352529775729738/]Item List[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[h1]For Information about NPCs, look here:[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\n[quote][list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1356955138/1743352529775804767/]NPC Tenants, guards, etc Information[/url][/list][/quote]\n\n[h1]Bug Reporting[/h1]\n[b]==========================================================================[/b]\nThis is a mod after all and ChuckleFish updates Starbound every once in a while. You may encounter issues with the mod upon game updates or you may have some problems with the visuals, drop rates, weapon power, etc.\nAs of such it would be very helpfull if you posted your errors.\n[quote][h1]Official Starbound Forums Reporting[/h1]\nFor those who want to upload their error log directly so we can view it easily, or are a normal member of the ChuckleFish forums, you can go here:\n[list][*][url=https://community.playstarbound.com/threads/lucario-race.136568/]Lucario Race Discussion on the Official Starbound Forums[/url][/list][/quote]\n[quote][h1]Steam Workshop Reporting[/h1]\nIf you don't have a ChuckleFish account or quickly want to report a problem, you can report here in the workshop.
