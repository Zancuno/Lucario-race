	"The history of the Lucario, is up to interpretation. Whether stated occurrences are the truth or are myths believed over time, is the subject matter for historical debate. Although what is certain is that there is a lack of ancient history and fossil records for the species. Thus the endeavors of historically recording the lucario species is a profession not many would like to have.",
	
	"What info we have, which is dubious at best, are mentions of the species from Apex codecies. Apparently at some time, the Apex discovered the species and subjugated them under their rule. They were mostly contained for scientific research due to their unusual properties that most would write off as superstition. This information though seems to be countered by documentation passed down from, amazingly, human sources.",
	
	"Most of the species name and biology that was not received from subjugated Lucario stems from an odd source of human knowledge. Documentation of this info suggests that of a foreign language and culture that strangely appeared one day in human history. The day of which this entered human records is unknown.",
	
	"The info recovered from these human sources refer to the Lucario species as a Pokemon, which seems to be a shorter version of saying Pocket Monster. Information about this seems to point out that Pokemon are their own Kingdom in Taxonomy, and Lucario being the genus and species. This suggest other variants of the Lucario species may exist but other from the modern mutations we have currently, this has yet to be seen.",
	
	"As to why a lucario is referred to as a Pokemon it seems to stem from information relating to something called a Pocket Ball, or Pokeball. According to the info of these reported sources, these were used to capture different species of pokemon from their natural environments for many purposes. These purposes entail simple things like pet ownership and other purposes that resemble organized fighting rinks.",
	
	"Although against these claims, there is no historical record of such a culture consisting of capturing pokemon and forcing them to battle until after these documentations came to light. What is most dubious of all is the disregard for the intelligence a lucario can aspire to; to be a simple pet controlled by a human. Further investigations into this matter seem to point out a subculture of humans that never existed prior and suddenly appeared in history.",
	
	"The research shows that this subculture shared their technology and culture with other human cultures. Although records of the subculture seem to dwindle down by the time the Terrene Protectorate became an active figurehead in the universe. There still do seem to exist some humans who still practice the culture of capturing Pokemon, although since the Protectorate, things seem to be a slightly more mutual relationship.",
	
	"Furthering this dilemma, it seems that these pokeballs no longer work as history tells and many of the pokemon existing in the universe are not captured by traditional means, but more so in a contractual agreement. Surprisingly though these pokeballs are coincidentally similar to capture pod technology, and if some reports are true, pokeballs may have returned in a way in some dark circles.",
	
	"Pokemon seem to have been a matter of sapient rights many times in the past, with much debate in the Terrene Protectorate over making laws against such cultures that would keep them captured. This in term is what started many of the investigations that we have documentation on now. As of late theories have been rising if the Pokemon Kingdom of taxonomy are even original to this universe.",
	
	"Certain species much like the Gallevoir hold strong beliefs of a lack of connection to this human subculture, speaking of origins outside of human pokeball trafficking. These species were the driving forces behind the sapient debates and were the ones to propose the outlaw of allowing capture pod technology from capturing sapient species. Other species like the Lopunny offer to preserve the ways of the subculture to something beneficial to both sides.",
	
	"Although matters regarding the Lucario race, seems to fluctuate between both sides. As history tells the Lucario have mentions of both being found by the Apex ages ago and records of mysteriously appearing alongside the human subculture. Since they have a history that conflicts, so did their early history among each other.",
	
	"The Lucario are a species that seem to sense the emotions of others but their experiences can often cloud facts. Conflictions between the lucario have resulted in many research projects being launched to find the origins of whose claims are true. In earlier years the Lucario seemed to be divided between a more passive culture and a more headstrong analytical culture. These seem to coincide with what origins they are stating.",
	
	"The lucario who claim their origins beside the human subculture were more so open to the idea of acceptance but they had a great deal of naivety. The lucario who claim their origins came from being found by the Apex are more judgmental and are less open to change. Both sides seem to narrow it down between arguments of domestication and instinct driven culture.",
	
	"The differences between both sides are the mutations we mostly see now in the species. The ones who claimed to appear beside the humans often have their spikes missing and or appendages on the back of their head fewer in number. As the lucario who were subjugated by the Apex often have more gender neutral bodies and traits of a said legendary mega biology, which refers to a genetic strain that can be unlocked in their DNA.",
	
	"As mentioned, the lucario who have ties to Apex subjugation tend to have small bits of their supposed mega biology due to reports of Apex experimentation on the lucario. Many could assume the growing toward a gender neutral physiology was due to the ration lifestyle they lived under Apex reign as they did not have the same rights as other Apex citizens.",
	
	"Documentation of past events and continuous efforts refer to what got the Lucario out of Apex subjugation from many years of Protectorate liberations. As of such the two cultures of the Lucario were introduced to each other under the Terrene Protectorate.",
	
	"Since the passing of time, the lucario cultures have since diverged from the several mixing and separations of cultures. Over time the majority adopted a tolerance philosophy, where they use their emotion detecting abilities to help dictate their decisions. Some say the Lucario can be great diplomats, but others note how easily they can be overwhelmed by stress due to the emotions of those around them.",
	
	"Although ever since the cultures accepted a tolerance philosophy, there has been an odd trend of the species as a whole, pursuing personal growth and betterment. Their minds tend to get cloudy from stress often, which may lead to spouts of aggression from time to time. Regardless of what past is behind them, the Lucario have always been excellent fighters, almost like as if it's in their blood.",
	
	"The headstrong culture they have now developed has led to many of them being active participants in the Terrene Protectorate. Some of the masses believe the Protectorate to be a good measure for growth in tolerance and personal improvement. Others though may stay on their home planets, meditating and constantly strengthening their bodies and minds for their own improvement."
