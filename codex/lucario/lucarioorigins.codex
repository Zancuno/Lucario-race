	"The history of the lucario is not something easily recordable. Whether stated occurrences are fact is dubious at best in most cases. There are so many conflictions and theories thrown about, that only a mad man would try to record it. I guess that makes me a mad man. As for the longest time now, I have tried to stitch together what fragments I could find.",
	
	"So where to begin? Is there even a beginning? From as far as I have seen it is impossible for me to do so. The lucario lack fossil records or any mention of existing until a specific era of time. I have no idea where they came from, or what they truly are. Asking a lucario about it only gets me so far.",
	
	"Why such interest in researching this then? I have no idea anymore. It's like I'm driven to uncovering the secret, as if it's only a step away. Well to carry on with what I do know, I have two documentations and what recent history was recorded. Although as if to make my life pain, all that I have conflicts.",
	
	"I have reports from a species called the lopunny, reports that question the entire structure of mythology on the Cultivator we barely have. Maybe there is more to be uncovered, but I do not know if things will still make sense.",
	
	"If anyone knew where Esther was, maybe we could get more answers, but she vanished long ago. Hardly anyone has seen her since, probably because of the obsession with learning about the Cultivator. Regardless the lopunny propose that the lucario came along with them, even though the lopunny as well lack any sort of history in our universe beyond a certain point.",
	
	"There is this talk revolving around the word Pokemon, and if it is to be believed, they propose that it is a Kingdom in Taxonomy. The lopunny swear up and down that the Lucario belong to the same Kingdom under that name.",
	
	"That is perfectly fine if Pokemon were a kingdom in taxonomy, but what baffles us is that they propose that they are genetic cousins to the lucario; which to my amazement is objectively true due to interracial families between the two species.",
	
	"The lopunny as a majority suggest a history that is not in any recorded codex of a time where the lopunny and lucario were subservient to humans. I as a human personally, was never taught about this nor can I find any record of it other than the efforts made by the lopunny to have close human relations.",
	
	"The lopunny though seem to be the more submissive of the two species I mostly talked to, and seem often want to mingle with Human culture in something benefitable to both. As for the Lucario, I am at a loss for words. Maybe it's because I inferred info from the lopunny, a different species and culture, but conflictions arose almost instantly.",
	
	"For one, the lucario are not as subservient to humans as the lopunny would tell. They often seem rather independent as a species, granted working with other species has expedited their progress as a species. Although upon asking different lucario on aspects of their history, things get complicated.",
	
	"I have lost sleep over this and probably seem insane to my colleagues at times, but I cannot find any binding similarities in the histories I was told. I have two rough histories that I can gather. The first theoretical history is that a subset of the lucario believe that they lived among humans in their early history.",
	
	"The lucario that side with humans in their early history do though seem to have something in common, as there are mutations now in the lucario, that what lucario do specialize in history state that were not present in their early history. The lucario that side with the humans theory often have decreasing amounts of head appendages and varying degrees of spike loss.",
	
	"Part of lucario anatomy is how their organic metal skeleton can protrude out of certain parts of their bodies to become spikes. This implies the spikes being used less or maybe something more. Alongside the implications of certain lucario gaining more defined gender different properties alongside humans, these changes in their anatomy do point to some kind of adaptation beside humans.",
	
	"I am assuming this now based on what I have gathered. Although it seems these lucario adapted to live with humans. The lack of spikes makes them easier to approach without knee jerk reactions causing people to be stabbed. It is almost as if these lucario were bred by humans in early history to fit certain aspects humans find subjectively cute.",
	
	"The main reason for this genetic cultivation theory is due to the lucario that state humans in early history often have a decreasing number of head appendages which looks similar to their early child, riolu, phase of development. Which this riolu stage in their growing development is often on most cases without a single spike until they start to mature.",
	
	"It is almost like what we humans did to our dogs, which is oddly coincidental considering their canine characteristics. Yet, while I could dive into theory territory further in the seemingly domestication lucario theory, there is another historical theory.",
	
	"The Big Ape Apex Regime have often been a problem for the Terrene Protectorate in these many years. Under the leadership of Big Ape, most of their civilians live in questionable conditions. It may seem like I am going off track here, but certain lucario sub groups state a period of time where they were subjugated by the Apex Regime.",
	
	"As I saw earlier in the domestication lucario theory, these apex origin lucario seem to have different body qualities in high probability. These lucario often are fully spiked, have more gender neutral bodies, and sometimes have strange colorful pattern alterations that match their eye color. These strange alternate body patterns are noted from the lucario to be of a legendary mega biology.",
	
	"It is apparently an innate genetic pattern in their DNA that by legend, can be unlocked through the power of mystical stones. Whether that is believable or not is another theory, but it seems the Apex under Big Ape were very interested.",
	
	"Among the two main theories, this one has the most documentation from recovered Apex codexes as the lucario were subjected to brutal experimentation. According to most apex origin lucario, they were found by the apex on some previous undocumented world. The apex had soon captured their home world and enslaved the lucario to what the Big Ape Regime refers to as ^red;Citizenship Establishments^reset;. ",
	
	"Under a false promise by Big Ape, the Lucario were told that they could work their way to becoming equals to the apex citizens under the Big Ape Regime. The Apex established this falsehood by appealing to the lucario's almost instinctual desire for self betterment by sometimes giving certain lucario the honor of being enlisted among the Big Ape Militia.",
	
	"As records would tell, this was mostly a farce. Even though the lucario have this ability to detect the emotions of others, they are not immune to being manipulated. Many lucario joined the armed ranks, being exceptional fighters as if their nature, which served as figure heads to keep the lucario in basically concentration camps from rebelling.",
	
	"The lucario under the Big Ape Regime were often experimented on for the glory of Big Ape. The Regime was interested in the abilities the lucario possessed of manipulating waveforms. Some records state the experimentation of trying to harvest their emotion sensing abilities and wave manipulation into a form of mind control.",
	
	"This mind control being written off as performance improvements for the Big Ape Militia, a way to motivate their troops. Thankfully most of these experiments ended in failure, but that didn't stop them from trying to bring the mega biology out. These lucario noted to have mega biology traits were often much stronger than their normal counterparts, but required a handler of sorts to keep them stable.",
	
	"This handler was also a tactic to keep these lucario as figureheads in the militia simply due to the lucario having to rely on a personal connection to remain sane. This led to lucario with the mega strain being often manipulated to believing in the Big Ape Regime and pushing for others in their species to follow their example.",
	
	"Such results on mega biology also were theorized to be used for the apex genetic manipulation projects for the miniknog. The lucario living in what were basically concentration camps that pretended to be towns, of course believed in their figureheads in the Big Ape Militia. As of such many of the lucario living there lived a food ration lifestyle which is where many theorize the gender neutral bodies came from.",
	
	"The lack of correct diet over time slowly changed their biology to adapt to basically a body form that fit constantly fighting for survival. Their gender neutral features were theorized to happen due to the lack of nutrition needed to develop those aspects of biology, so adaptation slowly phased them out. Although as time changes history, so would it for these lucario.",
	
	"The Terrene Protectorate and Big Ape Regime have fought each other for many years diplomatically and literally. As of such many of these encampments of lucario were discovered and liberated. At first things did not go well at all, as the lucario were naturally stronger than most species in the Terene Protectorate.",
	
	"Many lucario tried to cling to the culture they developed under the apex rule and there is much history of trouble trying to get these lucario to adapt to a new life style. Thankfully, and this is the astonishing part, the humans theory lucario were key influences in giving these lucario cultural therapy. As a lucario describes, the connection between their species can be a rather intense one.",
	
	"They can often pass on motives and intentions to one another without saying a word. As of such, these two main cultures leading up to today have mixed together and made something a lot more stable. As baffled as I could be by their oddly instinctual understanding of one another, remnants of the cultures remain.",
	
	"The lucario under humans theory are often a bit easier to accept ideals and thus are more naive. The lucario from the apex encampments, plagued by their harsh history till recent history, are very head strong and opinionated. While the lucario have adopted a more tolerating culture now, they are not as easily trusting of other species as they may imply in their daily interactions.",
	
	"The lucario, with their emotion sensing, often judge another person based on their aura, as it is called. So many lucario establishments are now often in remote locations, avoiding massive contact with other races. These barren mountainous locations that are not usually hospitable to most species under the Terrene Protectorate, but seem to be locations the lucario thrive in.",
	
	"Although the history still doesn't end there. As mentioned before, the lucario have this almost instinctual need for personal betterment, thus many seek some hierarchy. While many would prefer to remain on their now home planets to their own method of bettering themselves, a few like my colleague Lucas, have joined the Terene protectorate and try to reach favorable accomplishments.",
	
	"I have asked Lucas about much of this and thankfully through him, was able to contact many lucario of different historical theory groups. I am thankful for this opportunity, but this historical recording project has been one roller coaster to the next. I am tired, I have lost a lot of sleep, and I just want to bring this project to a close.",
	
	"There could be so many other things about this that I wouldn't know, but with how many conflicts there are in their history, I would be spending my entire life in research at this rate. For now, I am going to bring this project to a hold as I'm going to end my log here.",
	
	"Surprisingly this log is being published now, with how ambiguous the history of the lucario is, this seems to be one of the best takes on it. The Publisher is going to pass it around to fellow members of the Terrene Protectorate. With that, I must end with some words. If you feel like learning more, then this project may be complex but rewarding. There is so much more out there to find.",
	
	"The Terene Protectorate offers many races to come together and offers an ideal setting to explore these topics. We are about to have some great minds reach graduation soon. As a member of the Protectorate, I am proud of the accomplishments we have made now. We recently have had a lot more previously isolated races join the Terrene Protectorate for this upcoming graduation.",
	
	"If any of you are interested in helping to explore this history further, meet me after the graduation. I and a few others will be there to cheer our new graduates on. Thus, thank you for reading and hopefully I will meet our next great minds soon!
